# Leise_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary: My project is a game of Mancala that allows the user to play solo or against a friend. If the user selects solo, then I plan to implement an AI that uses either minimax or expectimax search to select optimal moves. Unfortunately I'll probably only have time to implement ascii graphics unless I finish early. Another possible addition could be different AI difficulties or AI hints when playing against a friend.
